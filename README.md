## Who can use these notebooks

### University and High-school Coding Instructors

Depending on the course level and topics covered, intructors can pick and choose appropriate chapters. E.g., we've used Chapter 1 - 15 (skipping some chapters such as as Functions-Lambda) in Beginning programing 3/4-credit university courses (CS0 and CS1) where students have no prior experience to programming. On the otherhand, we've also used all the chapters for 2-credit advanced programing courses where students have some prior programming experiences in Python or other programming languages (CS1, CS2 level).

### Self learners

Depending on their skill and interest level, learners can move as swiftly as appropairate through the chapters. Try solving some exercises towards the end of each chpater before moving on for self assessment of the mastery of the materails.

## How to use these notebooks

### Important

Inorder to learn coding, it's very important to actually type code on your own from scratch and NOT copy paste! You can run provided cells to see the output, follow along and learn from it but it's important that you either start a new jupyter notebook or add cells and write your own code from scratch to practice the concepts covered with many similar examples and solve the exercises provided.

### Online service

You can launch an interactive session of this project using online Binder service:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rambasnet/thinkpythonnotebooks/master)

### On a local system

To run these notebooks interactvely and save your work locally, you need <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3</a> and <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank"> Jupyter Notebook </a> -- an interactive web-based editor that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code and data. Anaconda or Miniconda is the recommended way to install Python and other packages on all modern platforms.

#### Installing via Anaconda or Miniconda

Anaconda or Miniconda has Python 3 and many other packages that you can easily install on any platform (Windows, Linux, and Mac). First, install Anaconda: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/ or Miniconda https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

After installing anaconda or miniconda, open a terminal and run the following commands:

    conda update conda
    conda install jupyter

#### Running the notebook server

Once Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook are installed, open a terminal change working directory using cd command to go into the folder where this repo is cloned and run the notebook from there:

    cd <directory where this repo is cloned>
    jupyter notebook

This will start a Jupyter session in your browser. Open a chapter, and start coding...
